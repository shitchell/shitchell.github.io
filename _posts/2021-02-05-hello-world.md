**finally.**

i've been wanting to start a blog for ages, but none of the platforms/tools i've used have been *just* right. call me blogilocks.

i decided to give things a shot using [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/) a couple of days ago---a phenomenal online tool for markdown files. they offer unlimited posts, support a *ridiculous* number of [features](https://hackmd.io/features), boast a gorgeous editor with live previews... just so much great stuff. it ticked basically all of my boxes, but it was still no match for my mastery of discontent.

ultimately, i forked jekyll-now, and i'm giving that a shot! i now have a place all my own to post 1337 c0d3, philosophical barfings, and excessive sunset pictures that no one will find interesting! :D
